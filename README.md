Dear Web Developer

Thank you for taking on this project. Our users are the general public looking for further information about the library and membership options. 
We require a new 4- page website with the following:

•	Home page – should include clear links to other features of the system that the users can access via a navigation bar.

•	About us page –  include the following blurb:

“Melbourne Public Library is an institution dating back to 1929. We have a range
of books, CDs, DVDs, magazines as well as a large range of downloadable content.”

•	Membership page – include membership information. Membership is free and gives them access to the library’s full catalogue. It should include an online form to apply for membership. The form must include name, email address and phone number.

•	Contact us page – should include the following contact information:

o	Telephone 1300 000 000

Our ICT Manager has stated he would like the following technical specifications within the website:

•	Create an attractive, uniform theme to be used throughout the website. It must look professional.

•	Use advanced CSS techniques (you must use version CSS3) when placing various elements on web pages:

o	CSS techniques must apply to all pages of the website and there must be only 1 CSS file.

o	Use CSS style to format the HTML elements (you must use HTML version 5).

o	Use at least 1 advanced CSS style for position and layout of the web pages, such as flexbox etc.

•	Use an advanced CSS style to create attractive visual effects, including shadows, gradients.

•	Use CSS style and ensure website suitability for PC and mobile.

•	A form aligned correctly with appropriate labels ad controls. 

•	New features of HTML, including <article>, <header>, <footer> 

•	3 images with appropriate alternative text (alt attributes).

•	An unordered list.

•	A functional navigation bar. 

•	A video (embed a YouTube video of your choosing, please follow the copyright policy).

•	New HTML elements, such as grids, to load the website on Mobile and PC.

•	Functions should be clear and easily accessible.

•	A single data storage(Json data)
